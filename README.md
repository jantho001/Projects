# Taylor Swift Radio Contest Project

This Python program automates the identification of currently playing artists on a radio station's website (Virgin Radio). It employs web scraping techniques to retrieve real-time information about the artist currently on air. Additionally, it includes a notification system utilizing Pushover to alert the user whenever Taylor Swift's music is being broadcasted. This feature was implemented to optimize participation in a contest that required timely responses to Taylor Swift's tracks.

## Features
**Web Scraping:** The program uses web scraping to fetch information from the radio station's website every 60 seconds, ensuring accurate and up-to-date details about the currently playing artist.

**Pushover Notification:** Integrated with Pushover, the program sends notifications to the user when Taylor Swift's music is detected.
